## Description
Welcome to the Social Underground, a place where you can meet with friends and play some games in a virtual casino. This is an application built so that users do not need multiple windows open to play a game and chat. The user will be able to be able to hangout with their friends while playing a fun game of blackjack or rock paper scissors at one of our "tables".

## How to use

4) If you start at a new table you must choose a game a play. We have created a fun version of  rock, paper, or scissors where you and another player can send snapshots back and forth using our integrated webcam.

5) Lastly we have a chat box at the bottom of each table so you can talk with your friends. 

6) Have fun!
